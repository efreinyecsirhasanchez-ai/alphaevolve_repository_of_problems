The path is defined by your list of 6D poses. The corridor has a specific, fixed geometry: it starts as a unit-width square tube along the negative X-axis, turns 90 degrees right (to follow the positive Y-axis), goes straight for a defined distance, then turns 90 degrees up (to follow the positive Z-axis), eventually opening into a large, unconstrained cubic region.\n",

For each sofa point, we draw a bounding box which contains the entire arc of the rotation (i.e., from the minimum to the maximum x-coordinate, and similarly for the y and z coordinates). We discard a point if its bounding box is not contained entirely within the corridor.\n",
