We also forbid the degenerate case of three distinct collinear points P, Q, R where Q is the midpoint of the segment PR (since d(P,Q)=d(Q,R)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Task:\n",
        "You must write a Python function that, for a parameter n, returns the best isosceles-free construction it can. \"Best\" means it contains the maximum number of points while not forming any isosceles triangles. Your function should return the construction, represented as a list of (x, y) integer tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates of a selected point. For example: [(0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0)].\n",
        "\n",
        "The input to your function will be an n value, which is the integer side length of the grid. This is guaranteed to be an integer, it will always be 64 or 100. All coordinates in your returned list must be within the range [0, n-1]. The parameter n will always be even.\n",

        "The normalized_score you are seeing describes the size of the set, divided by n. It is believed that the optimal constructions have a normalized_score of around 16/9. For n=64, the best known construction has 110 points, whereas for n=100 the best known construction has 160 points. Try to reach these numbers if you can. And once you've reached them, see how high you can push them!\n",

If you do not return anything for more than 2000 seconds, you will be disqualified for this particular round. You are more than welcome to use the full 2000 seconds for your search, there are no bonus points given for returning an answer quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimal construction will be very close to being symmetric around a horizontal and a vertical axis. These two symmetry axes might not meet exactly in the midpoint of the grid, their intersection could be off by 0.5 in one of the two directios (i.e. in the 64x64 grid, the two axes might intersect at at (31, 31.5) instead of the midpoint which is (31.5, 31.5)). The optimal construction can likely be obtained by modifying such a 4-fold symmetric construction by a very tiny bit.\n",
