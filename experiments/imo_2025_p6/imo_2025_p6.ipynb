        "Act as an expert in combinatorial optimization and computational geometry. Your task is to solve the following grid tiling problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Problem Statement:\n",
        "Consider an n by n grid of unit squares. You need to place non-overlapping rectangular tiles on this grid. The sides of each tile must align with the grid lines. Your goal is to find the minimum number of tiles required to cover the grid such that every row and every column has exactly one unit square that is not covered by a tile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Task:\n",
        "You must write a Python search function that, for a given grid size n, finds the best possible arrangement of tiles. \"Best\" means it satisfies the condition and uses the fewest tiles. Your function should return a list of tiles, where each tile is represented by a tuple of four integers: (row, column, height, width). The input to your function will be an 'n' value, which is the grid size. This is guaranteed to be an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluation:\n",
        "Your proposed tiling will be evaluated by the calculate_score function provided below. Your goal is to find a tiling that maximizes this score. A higher score means a better solution. The score is designed to heavily penalize solutions that violate the problem's constraints (e.g., overlapping tiles, tiles out of bounds, or incorrect number of uncovered squares per row/column). For a valid solution, the score is simply the negative of the number of tiles used, so maximizing the score is equivalent to minimizing the number of tiles.\n",

        "Search Function Requirements:\n",
        "Your search function will be given 10 seconds to run. After this time, it must return the best list of tiles it has found. Structure your search with a main loop like while time.time() - start_time \u003c 10: to manage the runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Big important hint: you must try to find a general solution to the problem. Instead of focusing on the search, I would strongly encourage you to try to find a general solution to the problem. Your program will be evaluated on some very large values of n, where the search won't help you -- try to find the pattern instead that works for all n.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second hint: much better configurations are possible than the program you are shown. The patterns you have to discover are not hard, you don't need to use any deep results at all. Always try to find a better pattern, don't be scared of the difficult sounding problem, once you see the solution you'll realise it wasn't hard at all. Good luck, I believe in you, but you also have to believe in yourself!\n",
